		<h1>Linking Firearm Laws to Firearm Deaths - Where's the 'Smoking Gun'?</h1>
		<h2>by Josh McElfresh and Lauren Middleton</h2>

		<h3>
			<p>
				Recent events in Colorado and Connecticut have brought firearm laws back into the public eye and political debates. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/us/politics/poll-finds-strong-support-for-tightened-gun-laws-and-path-to-citizenship.html?ref=us">Polling shows</a> that a majority of Americans support stricter gun control laws by large margins, but exacting new laws is proving difficult. After the latest attack, a bill to expand background checks when purchasing a firearm was drafted but failed to gain the required 60 votes in the Senate. President Obama called the vote "a shameful day for Washington."
			</p>
			<p>
				If such legislation were to pass what effect would we expect it to have on firearm deaths in the United States? This visualization attempts to explore this question by looking at firearm homicides from the period of 2006 - 2011, as well as a range of firearm laws in each state. The data for the four states below shows how the connection between firearm laws and firearm homicides can be difficult to make. Further study is needed to determine what other factors for a given state, such as presence of major cities or unemployment rate, may show a strong correlation to firearm homicide rates.
